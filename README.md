The provided JavaScript code initializes an interactive dashboard for exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Leveraging D3 for data manipulation and Plotly for visualization, the script fetches data from a JSON file, populates a dropdown menu with individual IDs, and constructs dynamic visualizations such as a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), a bubble chart representing OTUs based on their IDs and sample values, and a gauge chart indicating weekly washing frequency. Functions are implemented to update these visualizations and display corresponding metadata upon selecting different individuals from the dropdown menu, offering an interactive and informative exploration of the dataset.
